"""
A :class:`~brainscore.benchmarks.Benchmark` runs an experiment on a :class:`~brainscore.model_interface.BrainModel`
and tests the resulting measurements against primate `data <https://github.com/brain-score/brainio>`_.
This comparison is done by a :class:`~brainscore.metrics.Metric` which outputs a score of how well model and data match.
This score is normalized with data ceilings and the benchmark returns this ceiled score.

        Evaluate a candidate `BrainModel` and return a :class:`~brainscore.metrics.Score` denoting the brain-likeness of

        comparing model measurements (e.g. neural/behavioral) against recordings from biological subjects (e.g.
        primates) using a :class:`~brainscore.metrics.Metric`. The output of this method is a normalized score between 0
        and 1 where 0 means the model does not match the measurements at all and 1 means the model matches the
        measurements at ceiling level (e.g. if the model obtains a score of 0.8 and the data ceiling is also 0.8, the
        score output by this method should be 1).
